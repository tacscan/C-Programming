I'm getting back into C language to learn kernel and driver development. I'll be working on small projects as I get back into it and keeping them here.
1. monty.c - this is a simulation as alternative to Hello World.
2. projectEuler001.c - The sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 under 1000. 
3. projectEuler002.c - The sum of all the even numbers less than 4 million in the Fibonacci Sequence.
